Exercise 2.1
Starting with the definition of make-rat from the book:
(define (make-rat n d)
  (let ((g (gcd n d)))
    (cons (/ n g) 
          (/ d g))))

We want the denominator to always be positive, so

(define (make-rat n d)
  (let ((g (gcd n d))
        (s (if (< d 0) -1 1)))
    (cons (* s (/ n g))
          (* s (/ d g)))))
