Exercise 2.17
(define (last-pair l)
    (cond ((null? l) (error "Empty list"))
          ((null? (cdr l)) (car l))
          (else (last-pair (cdr l)))))

Exercise 2.18
(define (reverse l)
    (define (iter res l)
        (if (null? l)
            res
            (iter (cons (car l) res) (cdr l))))
    (iter () l))

Exercise 2.19
(define first-denomination car)
(define except-first-denomination cdr)
(define no-more? null?)

The order of the list wouldn't matter.
If you look at what the logic is saying, it's that the number of ways to make
an amount of money from certain coin values is the same as the sum of the number
of ways to make that amount using at least one of that coin and the number of ways
to make that amount using none of that coin. The combinatorial logic is unchanged
regardless of the order we look at the coins.

2.20
(define (same-parity x . l)
    (define (parity-filter p l)
        (if (null? l)
            ()
    (let ((rest (parity-filter p (cdr l))))
            (if (= p (remainder (car l) 2))
                (cons (car l) rest)
                rest))))
    (cons x (parity-filter (remainder x 2) l)))

2.21
(define (square-list items)
  (if (null? items)
      nil
      (cons (square (car items)) (square-list (cdr items)))))

(define (square-list items)
  (map (lambda (x) (* x x)) items))

2.22
The recursive version adds an item to the results of processing the parts
of the list that haven't been visited yet.
The iterative version adds an item to the results of processing the parts
of the list that have already been visited.

Switching the order of the arguments of cons doesn't work either.
This is because a list is defined as having the pointer to the rest
of the list in the cdr, and the data in the car. Switching the arguments
doesn't result in an extended list, it results in a nested list.

2.23
(define (for-each proc items)
    (if (null? items)
        true
        (proc (car items)) (for-each proc (cdr items))))

2.24
(list 1 (list 2 (list 3 4)))
from interpreter: (1 (2 (3 4)))

The drawings are in the same directory as this file.

2.25
(car (cdr (car (cdr (cdr list)))))
(car (car (list)))
(car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr l))))))))))))

2.26
(1 2 3 4 5 6)
((1 2 3) 4 5 6)
((1 2 3) (4 5 6))

2.27
First, let's copy down our reverse procedure.

(define (reverse l)
    (define (iter res l)
        (if (null? l)
            res
            (iter (cons (car l) res) (cdr l))))
    (iter () l))

(define (deep-reverse l)
    (define (revlist elem) (if (list? elem) (deep-reverse elem) elem))
    (define (iter res l)
        (if (null? l)
            res
            (iter (cons (revlist (car l)) res) (cdr l))))
    (iter () l))

2.28
Copying the same structure as the count-leaves function:
(define (fringe tree)
    (cond ((null? tree) ())
          ((not (pair? tree)) (list tree))
          (else (append (fringe (car tree)) (fringe (cdr tree))))))

(also, I only noticed this on rereading, but they capitalize the
function name when they use it at the start of a sentence, what the fuck)

2.29
A mobile is like, one of those hanging thingies, right?
Copied from text:

(define (make-mobile left right)
  (list left right))

(define (make-branch length structure)
  (list length structure))

1. write left-branch, right-branch, branch-length, branch-structure
(define left-branch car)
(define (right-branch mobile) (car (cdr mobile)))
(define branch-length car)
(define (branch-structure branch) (car (cdr branch)))

2.
(define (total-weight x)
  (if (not (pair? x))
      x
      (+ (total-weight (branch-structure (left-branch x)))
         (total-weight (branch-structure (right-branch x))))))

3.
(define (torque branch)
  (* (branch-length branch) (total-weight (branch-structure branch))))

(define (balanced x)
  (if (not (pair? x))
      true
      (let ((lb (left-branch x))
            (rb (right-branch x))
            (lbs (branch-structure (left-branch x)))
            (rbs (branch-structure (right-branch x))))
      (and (= (torque lb) (torque rb)) (balanced lbs) (balanced rbs)))))

4.
I would need to change right-branch and branch-structure.
Both would be equal to cdr, instead of (lambda (x) (car (cdr x)))
